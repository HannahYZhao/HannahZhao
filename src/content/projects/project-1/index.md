The "Tomography Scan" project on GitHub is a research-focused modular software designed to facilitate the analysis of bone scans. This tool, intended for research purposes and not medical diagnosis, boasts a user-friendly graphical interface with both dark and light modes, remembering user settings for convenience. Key features include a customizable process builder that allows users to create and integrate new nodes for extended functionality, and a cohesive process builder that combines alignment and visualization functionalities, reducing the need to switch between applications. The software was inspired by Ryven 3 and is built using technologies like vtk, PySide2, QtPy, pandas, and ryvencore. Acknowledgments are given to various icons' creators and tutorial inspiration for the project's development.
