The Mood Tracker app is an innovative Android mobile application designed to enhance emotional well-being by recognizing a user's current mood through facial recognition technology. Upon scanning a userâ€™s selfie, the app employs advanced mood recognition algorithms to accurately identify the user's emotional state. Based on the detected mood, the app then suggests a variety of activities tailored to improve the user's emotional health. These activities range from listening to music and watching motivational videos to engaging in mindfulness exercises and physical activities, all aimed at promoting a positive change in mood.
